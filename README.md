# CircleChain
Another quick object oriented project using the Processing Development Environment w/ Python

The objects specified in Circles.py allow one to create a circle of any size and color, then create 
a chain of any number of circles.  Both the change (first derivative) in the xy position, radius, and color between each 
circle, as well as how the change in each of those attributes changes (second derivate) between circles can be 
specified.

The example implementation found in the CircleChain.py file created the following images:
